# lost_and_found

WHAT IF I HAVE ANOTHER CHANGE I WANT TO PUSH??????

•	Users will login and enter the details of an item they are looking for/have lost
o	Such as:
	Description.
	Where lost.
	If an award is offered.
	Whom to contact when found (and how to contact).

•	Above information will be updated onto a “lost” table/database

•	“lost” table will be posted to site where users can view list of lost items.  Where they may then update the items as “found”.
